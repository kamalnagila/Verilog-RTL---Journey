This module implements an overlapping sequence detector for the binary pattern 10110 using a Mealy finite state machine. The output is asserted immediately when the final bit of the sequence is detected.

Key Features

>> Detects sequence: 10110

>> FSM type: Mealy

>> Supports overlapping sequences

>> Synchronous design with asynchronous reset

>> Written in RTL Verilog
