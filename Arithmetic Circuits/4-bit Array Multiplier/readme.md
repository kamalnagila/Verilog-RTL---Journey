This project implements a 4-bit array multiplier using pure RTL Verilog.
Instead of using the built-in * operator, the multiplier is designed by explicitly generating partial products and summing them, similar to how binary multiplication is done on paper.

The goal of this project is to understand the hardware behind multiplication, not just get the correct output.
