# Verilog RTL Design Journey

## Overview
This repository contains my **Verilog RTL design learning journey**, where I implemented
a collection of digital hardware blocks to strengthen my understanding of
**combinational logic, sequential logic, FSMs, memory elements, and basic system-level designs**.

All designs are written in **synthesizable Verilog HDL** and verified using
**simple directed testbenches**.

>  Note:
> These implementations are **learning-oriented RTL models** and are not
> intended to be production-grade or fully standard-compliant protocol designs.
